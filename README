Wordstack

This is an Android Application developed as part of the Applied Computer Science with Android Course.

The idea of the game is to try to separate out two words of the same length whose letters have been scrambled (but the order of the letters has been preserved). 

I have implemented the extension asking for drag and drop for undo and between words.
